Flow of Authentication
User Navigates to /login:

Your /login route handler calls passport.authenticate('google').
This middleware:
Redirects the user to Google's login page (along with the client ID, scope, etc.).
No callback function or route handler executes here because the user is leaving your application to log in with Google.
Google Redirects Back to /redirect:

After the user logs in on Google and grants permissions, Google redirects them back to the callbackURL (in this case, /redirect).
The redirect includes an authorization code in the query string, which your app can use to fetch the user's profile and access token.
Middleware on /redirect Executes:

The middleware passport.authenticate('google') on the /redirect route is called. This middleware:
Processes the authorization code.
Exchanges the authorization code for an access token and profile information.
Executes the callback function provided when configuring the GoogleStrategy.
If the callback function successfully authenticates the user (calls done(null, user)), Passport considers the authentication successful.
If Successful, Route Handler for /redirect Executes:

Once the passport.authenticate('google') middleware completes, control moves to the route handler for /redirect.
In your case:
javascript
Copy code
app.get("/redirect", passport.authenticate('google'), (req, res) => {
    res.sendStatus(200); // Final response to the user
});
Key Notes
The /redirect route is not called multiple times. The flow is:

Google redirects to /redirect.
The middleware processes the request and executes the callback function.
The route handler for /redirect is executed after the middleware succeeds.
The callback function (from GoogleStrategy) is executed as part of the middleware on /redirect. It is not tied directly to the route handler.

Simplified Flow:
Step 1: User visits /login. Redirects to Google.
Step 2: Google redirects the user back to /redirect with an authorization code.
Step 3: The passport.authenticate('google') middleware on /redirect processes the code and executes the callback function in the GoogleStrategy.
Step 4: If successful, the /redirect route handler runs and sends the final response.
Misconception Cleared
"/redirect will not be called multiple times."
The route /redirect is called only once by Google during the redirection after login.
Inside /redirect, Passport handles the logic for fetching the user's profile and authenticating them, and then your route handler responds.
